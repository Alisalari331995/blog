The previous Skycoin China marketing team (EVOLAB) were found to have embezzled approximately 100,000 skycoins, some of which were dumped on the market in the past week. In light of this discovery and their failure to return or account for the embezzled coins, the relationship with this team was terminated.

Following this event, on the evening of June 13th 2018, nine individuals, including/led by marketing team members Sam Sing Fong, Mary Li (李臻/李敏), Xiangdong Yan (闫向东) and Jesse Sun Fei (孙飞) burglarized Synth’s home. They proceeded to hold Synth and his wife against their will for 6 hours, over the course of which they threatened, beat and robbed them. Thanks to wallet security measures, the group was only able to extract 18.88 Bitcoin and 6466 skycoins during the robbery. The gang also attempted and failed to steal the design framework for the skycoin ecosystem.

The total number of skycoins stolen by these individuals is still being determined, and the addresses containing stolen coins are also being documented. In response to these events a black-listing function has been developed to limit the impact of such events.

At the same time, the primary exchanges were notified asking them to temporarily freeze the accounts of the criminal suspects. Frozen assets will be dealt with after the investigation has been concluded.

Since some of the community social media accounts or Telegram groups were created by the EVOLAB team, Skycoin community members wishing to stay connected should subscribe to the groups mentioned on the Skycoin website ([www.skycoin.net](https://www.skycoin.net)).
